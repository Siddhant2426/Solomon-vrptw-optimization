# Vehicle Routing Optimization using Genetic Algorithm

## Problem Statement
The objective of this project is to optimize delivery routes for multiple vehicles
while minimizing total travel distance under vehicle capacity and customer time
window constraints.

## Dataset
Solomon Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (VRPTW) benchmark dataset.
The C101 instance is used for experimentation.

## Methodology
1. Implemented a baseline heuristic routing approach.
2. Designed a Genetic Algorithm to optimize route sequences.
3. Incorporated penalties for capacity and time window violations.
4. Compared optimized results with baseline performance.

## Results
The Genetic Algorithm achieved approximately 15% reduction in total travel distance
compared to the baseline heuristic while satisfying all constraints.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of optimization techniques to real-world
logistics and supply chain problems.
